# Learn-CPython

Here, you can find some exercises that I used to learn CPython.

For each exercise, you can find my solution. This is not the absolute one!

CPython offers the option to use C or C++. I will use C++; feel free to use either one.

The exercises are sorted by level:
1. Beginner

> [!NOTE]
> For C or C++ compilation, I use a Docker image, but you can also use a virtual environment (venv).
