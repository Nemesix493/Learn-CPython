# Learn-CPython

version = 0.0.3

Here, you can find some exercises that I used to learn CPython.

For each exercise, you can find my solution. This is not the absolute one!

CPython offers the option to use C or C++. I will use C++; feel free to use either one.

The exercises are sorted by level:

**Beginner**
1. [Sum of Even Numbers](Beginner/1_Sum_of_Even_Numbers/)
2. [Count Vowels](Beginner/2_Count_Vowels/)
3. [Factorial Calculation](Beginner/3_Factorial_Calculation/)

> [!NOTE]
> For C or C++ compilation, I use a Docker image, but you can also use a virtual environment (venv).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Requirements
>
> To do these exercises, I recommend having a strong foundation in Python and C/C++.

## Organization

I use Git Flow, so in the `master` branch, you can find the finished exercises with my solutions. In the `develop` branch and subbranches, you can find the most recently added exercises, which may be unfinished and/or without my solutions.
