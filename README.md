# Learn-CPython

version = 0.0.4

Here, you can find some exercises that I used to learn CPython.

For each exercise, you can find my solution. This is not the absolute one!

CPython offers the option to use C or C++. I will use C++; feel free to use either one.

## Organization

I use Git Flow, so in the `master` branch, you can find the finished exercises with my solutions. In the `develop` branch and subbranches, you can find the most recently added exercises, which may be unfinished and/or without my solutions.
